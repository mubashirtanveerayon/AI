1. Brief description of AF1 database
-------------------------------------------------------
AF1 is an Afrikaans male diphone database provided in the
context of the MBROLA project (http://tcts.fpms.ac.be/synthesis).

It consists of 950 diphones.Only actually permissable combinations were taken into account.

We use the SAMPA phonetic alphabet for Text-to-Speech systems, and in developing a grapheme-to-phoneme converter for Afrikaans. For the SAMPA symbol set, as well as examples for each, cf. (http://www.phon.ucl.ac.uk/home/sampa/afrikaans-draft.htm). In the case of the primary diphthongs we made alternations: [@I] has been substituted by [&], [9y] by [}], and [9u] by [$]. 

AF1 database was recorded, segmented and processed by 
Daan Wissing (ntldpw@puk.ac.za), in the Human Language Technology Laboratory 
of the Faculty of Arts, North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, South Africa.

REMARKS: 
Some of these symbols are different from that used in SAMPA for Afrikaans on the Web (http://www.phon.ucl.ac.uk/home/sampa/afrikaans-draft.htm): Long vowels are not indicated here by using a colon (e.g. [e:]); the symbols [& $ }] for diphthongs substitute respectively [@I 9u 9y].
[h] and [j] are sometimes treated as fricatives, sometimes as semivowels.
